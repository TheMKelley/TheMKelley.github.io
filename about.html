<p>I am a student at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, where I am studying for my BS degree in Computer and Information Sciences and participate in Division I Cross Country and Track and Field. Originally from Virginia Beach, Virginia, my interest in computers and network security began in high school during my dual enrollment into the Advanced Technology Center at Tidewater Community College.</p>
